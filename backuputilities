In second it will extract or take backkupof the specified tape

-----
Histroy

depending upon the shell used it can be noted that each and every shell have different integer number to store the history of last typed command

these variables can be used in script and output can be found ,,also shell set limit can be discovered

set History=100 savehist=50

$history 10 

built in command to print last 10 histroy done in OS or last 10 commands used 

you can repeat the last command using $!! command

C shell History SUbstitute

!!--repeat the last command 

!n--repeat the last n commands

!-n   --repeat command n from last
!str--repeat   command that starts with str

!?str?--repeat command with string str any where on line

!str?%-select the first argument that has the string str in it 
!:n--  select the n argument from the last commmand
!:n-m--select the nth from mth from tha last command
!^--sleect the first argument from the last command 
!$ --select all arguments from the last comand 




----------------

Identity

you are a user and associated with one or many groups in the OS environment 

$id 

output--uid-1101(frank) gid=89(staff)

On other systems it might also display group info

$id 

output--uid-1101(frank) gid=89(staff)  groups =10 (staff),5 operator,14 sysadmin,110(outs)




-------------

you can define limit for a size on Unix Os.

to set it

$ulimit 2097152 

this will make sure that any file created on disk will not exceed morethan the above set limit..
