Echo is useful for many purposes but still inadequate to get only columns from file or any data

for this disadvantage we have printf command 

same as c language printf command 


$printf "this is a number %d" 10

this is a number 10

d---  interger
u-- Unsigned Int
o-- octal int
x-- hexadecimal int
X-- Haxa decimal using A-F
c-- single char
s--String
b-- String containing backslashes
%-- percent sign

$printf "the octal value for %d is %o " 20 20

the octal value for 20 is 24

$printf  "A string %s and a character %c \n " hello A

A string hello and a character A


$printf "%d \n % d\n  % d\n "10 10 20

10
 -10
20
