Processes:


UniX is a ulti user OS.and process from different user can be at same time run in that OS

OPtions :

-a all processes
-e  -- environment / everything 
-g  process group leader as well

-l-- long format

-u-- user oriented result 

-x-- even processes not executed from this terminal

-f-- full listing 

-w-- report first 132 characters fro line 

$ps

given info about the processes running in OS

$ps -a

If want to know whats are alll processes runnig for all users who are logged in then use -a option

$ps -u user_name_or_ID  

the above command gives the info w.r.t that user only 

$ps -t tty3d

If want to know processes that are run from other particluar terminal then -t will be handy


$ps-f 
Any more additional info then -f will be handy


Background processes:

use & ambersend symbol against any command to make that process run in background .Using & makes sure that process is run in background but disadvantage is that youill not know if sucessfully exected or not 

and if output has been generated , or command sucesssfully run.Even it gets terminated if user logs off

$sort hello.dat >NIt..out & 176 53  ((176 and 53 are processids and job ids assigned by user himself))


SO for above disadvantage there is other command which is in family of background process only but confirms and makes sure that its executed sucesfully or for any 
command if no output is redirected then its stored in nohup.out 

$nohup sort hello.dat >NIt.out


Killing a process

How to kill a process

You have to know the process id or simply in unix terms its PID



$ps
$kill 6173

to confirm the kill you can use -9 


$kill  -9  6173



$at  and batch $batch((do be done by student )) __ 





&& construct and || construct



if two commands are jointly used then sucess of one(first) will execute the other for && and failure of one (first command )) will execute the other 

Ex:

$ sort bigdata >/temp/sortout && mv /temp/sortout bigdata

here as && is used only if file bigdata is sorted or if file bigdata exists then  move command wilbe executed .its same as 



if sort bigdata >/temp/sortout
then
  mv /temp/sortout bigdata

fi


the command 
[-z "$EDITOR"]&& EDITOR=/bin/ed




|| command 


can be understood it as if first fails then only second section of command is executed 


$grep "$name" pbook || echo "Couldnot find $name "
